## What I'm currently :brain:washed by

- pragmatic functional programming with a [rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM "Rich Hickey: The Value of Values") flavor
- the playfulness and curiosity of [dabeaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkCLMl0e_0k " David Beazley: Lambda Calculus from the Ground Up")
- the [teachings of Tony Kay](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s4-e6-fulcro-with-tony-kay-part-1/id1461500416?i=1000479361034 "Clojurestream Podcast: Fulcro with Tony Kay")
- [zombie-themed pairing sessions](https://youtu.be/6qnNtVdf08Q "braaains")
  
## Where I see myself in 2026

- doing FOSS contributions
- in co-working atmospheres
- interning at a friendly tech company
